    "## Introduction And Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "As the AI job market continues to grow, it is particularly interesting to analyze the individuals driving this change and the salaries they are given. The rapid expansion of remote work has transformed how AI professionals work, raising questions about whether traditional salary hierarchies based on experience still hold in remote settings, and whether specialized technical roles command different premiums than generalist positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research aims to identify patterns in salary differences based on experience level, role type, and work arrangement. For recent graduates and career changers, understanding how remote work affects salary progression informs critical decisions about career paths and negotiation strategies. For employers, these insights are essential for structuring competitive compensation in an evolving market where remote work and AI specialization reshape traditional pay structures.\n",

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question: \n",
    "\n",
    "In the US AI job market, does remote work reduce the salary premium traditionally associated with higher experience levels, and do specialized technical roles (Machine Learning Engineers, Research Scientists) show different patterns compared to generalist roles (Data Scientists, Data Analysts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Definitions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Salary premium:** The percentage increase in compensation as workers advance from entry-level to senior-level positions, calculated as (Senior median salary - Entry median salary) / Entry median salary × 100%\n",
    "- **Specialized roles:** Positions requiring deep machine learning and AI expertise (e.g., Machine Learning Engineer, Research Scientist, Computer Vision Engineer)\n",
    "- **Generalist roles:** Broader data science and analytics positions (e.g., Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "Posted salaries may not reflect actual negotiated compensation, which could overstate or understate true market rates. The dataset lacks information on total compensation (equity, bonuses, benefits), meaning our salary comparisons may be incomplete—particularly for senior roles where equity often comprises a significant portion of pay. Without company identifiers, we cannot control for company-specific effects, so observed patterns might reflect which companies hire remote workers rather than remote work's true effect on salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class imbalance (79% on-site vs 21% remote) may reduce statistical power to detect remote work effects, and any significant p-values should be interpreted cautiously given this imbalance. Additionally, as a single-year snapshot, we cannot determine whether observed patterns are stable trends or temporary market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Addressing Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To address class imbalance, we include confidence intervals and focus on effect sizes rather than p-values alone. We control for company size in our regression models to partially account for company-level variation. We use median salaries rather than means for descriptive comparisons, which are more robust to the skewed salary distributions common when equity and bonuses are excluded. We also clearly frame our findings as correlational, not causal, and acknowledge in our conclusions what this data can and cannot tell us. Future research could address remaining limitations by incorporating longitudinal data, total compensation figures, and company-level controls.\n",

    "**Strengths**\n",
